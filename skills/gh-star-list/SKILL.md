# GitHub Star List

Organize GitHub starred repos into GitHub Lists automatically.

## Prerequisites

Verify environment before starting. Run these checks and guide user through any failures:

```bash
# 1. Check gh CLI installed
gh --version || echo "MISSING"

# 2. Check gh authenticated with 'user' scope
gh auth status  # must show 'user' in scopes

# 3. Check jq installed
jq --version || echo "MISSING"
```

**Troubleshooting:**

| Problem              | Solution                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `gh` not installed   | macOS: `brew install gh`. Others: <https://cli.github.com>               |
| `gh` not logged in   | `gh auth login -h github.com -p https -w` (opens browser)                |
| `user` scope missing | `gh auth refresh -s user -h github.com`                                  |
| `jq` not installed   | macOS: `brew install jq`. Others: <https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download> |

All checks must pass before proceeding. The `user` scope is required for GitHub Lists API access.

## Scripts

All scripts are in `scripts/` relative to this skill's directory.

| Script            | Purpose                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fetch_stars.sh`  | Fetch starred repos (paginated). Outputs one JSON object per line. |
| `manage_lists.sh` | CRUD for GitHub Lists: `get`, `create`, `delete`, `add`            |

## Modes

### Mode 1: Full Batch (default)

Categorize all starred repos at once. Trigger: "整理所有 stars", "organize all my stars".

### Mode 2: Selective

Categorize specific repos or the latest N stars. Trigger: "整理最近 10 个 star", "把 xxx/yyy 加到合适的 list".

When no specific repos are mentioned and user says "整理一下" without "所有/全部/all", default to **latest 10 stars**.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Data

**Full batch mode:**

```bash
bash scripts/fetch_stars.sh > /tmp/stars.jsonl
bash scripts/manage_lists.sh get > /tmp/lists.json
```

**Selective mode (latest N):**

```bash
bash scripts/fetch_stars.sh --limit N > /tmp/stars.jsonl
bash scripts/manage_lists.sh get > /tmp/lists.json
```

For specific repos, use `gh api` to fetch individual repo info:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '{id: .node_id, full_name: .full_name, description: (.description // ""), topics: (.topics // []), language: (.language // ""), url: .html_url}'
```

Tell user how many stars to process and how many existing lists found.

### Step 2: Analyze and Propose Categories

Read `/tmp/stars.jsonl` and `/tmp/lists.json`.

Analyze all repos and existing lists. Propose a categorization plan.

#### Classification Principles (IMPORTANT)

1. **Classify by PURPOSE, not language** (unless the user explicitly requests language-based grouping): A Rust-written JS bundler belongs in "Build & DX", not "Rust". A Swift-written clipboard tool belongs in "CLI & Tools", not "iOS". Language is metadata, not category.
2. **Description > Topics > Name > Language**: Prioritize description to understand what the repo DOES. Language is the weakest signal and should only be used as a tiebreaker.
3. **Ask "what does this repo help the user DO?"**: A framework for building mobile apps → Mobile. A linter for Python → Build & DX. A deepfake tool → AI or Misc.
4. **Avoid over-broad categories**: If a list exceeds 40 items, consider splitting by sub-purpose.
5. **Framework vs Library vs Tool**: Web frameworks (Express, Hono, Koa) → Backend. UI component libraries (Ant Design, shadcn) → UI & Design. Build tools (Vite, Rspack) → Build & DX.

#### Recommended Categories

Use these as a starting template for full batch mode. Adjust based on user's actual star composition — skip empty categories, merge small ones, split large ones (>40 repos).

| Category           | Description                                          | Typical repos                       |

| CLI & Tools        | Desktop apps, CLI utilities, productivity            | homebrew, raycast, warp             |
| UI & Design        | Component libraries, CSS, animation                  | tailwindcss, shadcn, framer-motion  |

| Awesome & Learning | Curated lists, tutorials, books, courses             | awesome-xxx, free-programming-books |
| Misc               | Repos that don't fit elsewhere                       |                                     |

#### Category Guidelines

- **Respect existing lists**: Keep lists that already have items. Prefer assigning to existing lists when they match.
- **Generate new categories**: Only for repos that don't fit any existing list.
- **Total lists cap**: Stay within GitHub's 32-list limit.
- **Full batch**: Target 15-25 total lists.
- **Selective**: Prefer assigning to existing lists; only propose new lists if truly needed.

Present the plan as a table. Wait for user confirmation or adjustments.

### Step 3: Execute

After user confirms:

1. Create new lists: `bash scripts/manage_lists.sh create "<name>" "<description>"`
2. Collect all list IDs (existing + new)
3. Add repos to lists: `bash scripts/manage_lists.sh add <repo_node_id> <list_id>`

**Critical**: The `add` command calls `updateUserListsForItem` which **replaces** all list memberships for a repo. The `listIds` param is the **complete** set of lists the repo should belong to. To preserve existing membership, include ALL list IDs (old + new) in a single call.

Full batch: process in batches, report progress every 50 repos.
Selective: process all at once.

### Step 4: Summary

Run `bash scripts/manage_lists.sh get` and present a summary table showing list name, repo count, and whether each list is new or existing.
